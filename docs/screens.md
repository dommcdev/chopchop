# Screens Overview

This section covers the draft screens for ChopChop and how users move through the application. The screens outline the main pages and the information shown on each one and are meant to guide development rather than represent a final design.

## Draft Screen 1: Login and Account Creation

**Purpose**
Allow users to create an account or log in to access their recipe collection.

**Screen Contents**

- Email input field
- Password input field
- Login button
- Link to create a new account
- Error message for invalid login attempts

After logging in successfully, the user is taken to the Home/Recipe Library screen.

## Draft Screen 2: Home/Recipe Library

**Purpose**
Serve as the main landing page where users can view and manage their saved recipes.

**Screen Contents**

- Navigation bar with links to Home, Upload Recipe, and Settings
- Search bar for recipes
- List or grid of saved recipes showing:
  - Recipe title
  - Category or tag (if applicable)
  - Prep or cook time (if available)
- Button to upload a new recipe
- Empty state message when no recipes are saved

Clicking a recipe opens the Recipe Viewer screen. Selecting the upload option takes them to the Recipe Upload screen.

## Draft Screen 3: Recipe Upload (PDF or Image)

**Purpose**
Allow users to add a new recipe by uploading an image or PDF file.

**Screen Contents**

- File upload area (file picker or drag and drop)
- Supported file types (PDF, JPG, PNG)
- Upload progress indicator

- Error message for unsupported files

Once the file is uploaded, it is processed by the backend using the Gemini API. The user is then redirected to the Recipe Editor screen to review the extracted information.

## Draft Screen 4: Recipe Editor

**Purpose**
Allow users to review and edit the recipe data generated by the AI.

**Screen Contents**

- Editable fields for:
  - Recipe title
  - Description
  - Number of servings
  - Preparation and cook time
- Editable list of ingredients including:
  - Ingredient name
  - Quantity
  - Unit
- Editable list of instruction steps
- Category selection
- Save and View buttons

After saving, the recipe is stored in the database and becomes available in the Recipe Library.

## Draft Screen 5: Recipe Viewer

**Purpose**
Display a clean, read-only version of a recipe for cooking, sharing, or printing.

**Screen Contents**

- Recipe title and description
- Ingredient list with quantities scaled based on serving size
- Step by step instructions
- Controls to adjust servings
- Buttons to edit, share, or export the recipe as a PDF

Users can return to the library, edit the recipe, create a shareable link, or export the recipe.

## Draft Screen 6: Settings and Export

**Purpose**
Provide account settings and data export options.

**Screen Contents**

- Account information
- Option to export all recipes as a JSON file
- Option to export recipes as PDFs
- Logout button

Changes made here apply to the user account and stored data.

## Summary

These draft screens define the basic structure and user flow of the ChopChop application. They will be used as a reference when implementing frontend components and backend integrations. Final visual styling will be addressed later in development once core functionality is complete.
